/* For the 2nd Twist I found the next formula: 
 * 
 * If n is even then k = n/2:
 * F(n) = [2*F(k-1) + F(k)]*F(k)
 * 
 * If n is odd then k = (n + 1)/2
 * F(n) = F(k)*F(k) + F(k-1)*F(k-1)
 * 
 * As we can see, this formula will find the
 * nâ€™th Fibonacci Number in O(Log n) time.
 *
 * We can create a recursive method using the
 * recurrence formula above.
 * 
 * Maybe I will be able to code that soon, when
 * my java syntax knowledge will increase.
